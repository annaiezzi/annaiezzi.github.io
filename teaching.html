<p>As a postdoc, I have currently a teaching load of two courses per year at the University of South Florida.</p>
	
<p>From the academic year 2013/2014 to 2016/2017, I did my teaching at Aix-Marseille Université.
	</p>
	<p>Before, during my third year of Bachelor's degree and my first year of Master's degree at the Università degli studi di Roma 3, I was a tutor for several courses of second and third year of Bachelor's degree in Mathematics.</p>
