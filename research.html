		<p> My research work lies at the interface between <strong>algebraic geometry</strong> and <strong>number theory</strong> and often consists in addressing a pure mathematical problem coming from applied areas, such as <strong>cryptography</strong> and <strong>coding theory</strong>.</p> 
	
		<p> In my <a href="documents/these.pdf">Ph.D thesis</a> (supervised by <a href="http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~aubry/aubry.html">Yves Aubry</a>) I considered  the problem of building singular curves over finite fields with many rational points. My work is based on notions and tools from commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and combinatorics. </p> 
		
		<p> More recently I have started working in a young and very active subfield of <strong>post-quantum cryptography</strong>, called <strong>isogeny-based cryptography</strong>, which is based on the arithmetic of elliptic curves over finite fields. In this context I am mainly interested in mathematical problems which are behind the security of isogeny-based cryptosystems, such as the study of the structure of supersingular isogeny graphs and the efficient computation of the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve defined over a finite field.
		</p>
		
		<p> I am also interested in  problems from number theory that can be reduced to the study of algebraic varieties over finite fields.
		</p>
		
	<p> Finally, in my reaseach work I love collaborating with people in order to exchange our different points of view on a given topic. To me, this is the best way to learn new tools and methods, while discovering and having fun!

									<p>
										In this Ph.D thesis, we focus on some questions about the maximum number of rational points on a singular curve defined over a finite field. This topic has been extensively discussed in the smooth case since Weil's works. We have split our study into two stages. First, we provide a construction of singular curves of prescribed genera and base field and with many rational points: such a construction, based on some notions and tools from algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, yields a method for constructing, given a smooth curve $X$, another curve $X'$ with singularities, such that $X$ is the normalization of $X'$, and the added singularities are rational on the base field and with the prescribed singularity degree. Then, using a Euclidian approach, we prove a new bound for the number of closed points of degree two on a smooth curve defined over a finite field.Combining these two a priori independent results, we can study the following question: when is the Aubry-Perret bound (the analogue of the Weil bound in the singular case) reached? This leads naturally to the study of the properties of maximal curves and, when the cardinality of the base field is a square, to the analysis of the spectrum of their genera.
